I am a Master of Science in Statistics student at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. In 2015 I earned a degree of Bachelor of Science in Economics by the Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil. 

My MSc dissertation is focused on the analysis of individual treatment effects estimated through Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) models and its extensions.
