I am a Master of Science in Statistics student at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. In 2015 I earned a degree of Bachelor of Science in Economics by the Federal University of São Paulo, in Brazil. 

My main interest related to Statistics is based on Time Series and the application of Bayesian models and techniques. My MSc dissertation is focused on the application of Bayesian Aditive Regression Trees (BART) models and its extensions to individual treatment effect estimation.
